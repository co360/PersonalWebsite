# Personal Website

# Project Proposal

I have decided to gather requirements, put those requirements into a coherent and consistent design and thereafter implement and test my own personal website where people in general or my friends can find out more about myself, my education, my work experience, my life and my hobbies whoever is interested.

The main scope of this project is to design and develop a personal website for myself that conveys my life and skills to other people, or potentially employers when I will apply for a role as a Software Engineer at a company, hence the employer might ask me if I have a personal website.

My personal website will start off fairly basic and fairly minimalistic with a clean and pleasant looking homepage whereby the users will first access when visiting my website. After implementing the HTML5 & CSS3 frontend of my website I will then migrate over to the backend where I will implement Express JavaScript code to handle the server-side backend functionality such as implementing different routes between the different links that my website will have.


Before gathering any requirements for the personal project, I will perform a small feasibility study that determines and takes into account many factors such as economic, schedule and technical feasibility. These studies will determine whether or not the project is feasible to develop or not in terms of time constraints, any costs that might be incurred or if any special equipment might be necessary.


I will be making use of a website called “Zube” where I will outline all of the requirements that my personal website will have in the form of a Spring Backlog, thereafter I will take the requirements from the sprint backlog and compile them into a single Agile sprint that will show the time taken for each of the requirements.

# Economic Feasibility Study

There will be no costs incurred during the development of this project, I will not be spending any money on any special software. All of the software that I will be using to develop this project will be free.

I will list the software and tools that I will be using to implement the functionality and design of the website.
