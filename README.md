# Personal Website

# Project Proposal

I have decided to gather requirements, put those requirements into a coherent and consistent design and thereafter implement and test my own personal website where people in general or my friends can find out more about myself, my education, my work experience, my life and my hobbies whoever is interested.

The main scope of this project is to design and develop a personal website for myself that conveys my life and skills to other people, or potentially employers when I will apply for a role as a Software Engineer at a company, hence the employer might ask me if I have a personal website.

My personal website will start off fairly basic and fairly minimalistic with a clean and pleasant looking homepage whereby the users will first access when visiting my website. After implementing the HTML5 & CSS3 frontend of my website I will then migrate over to the backend where I will implement Express JavaScript code to handle the server-side backend functionality such as implementing different routes between the different links that my website will have.


Before gathering any requirements for the personal project, I will perform a small feasibility study that determines and takes into account many factors such as economic, schedule and technical feasibility. These studies will determine whether or not the project is feasible to develop or not in terms of time constraints, any costs that might be incurred or if any special equipment might be necessary.


I will be making use of a website called “Zube” where I will outline all of the requirements that my personal website will have in the form of a Spring Backlog, thereafter I will take the requirements from the sprint backlog and compile them into a single Agile sprint that will show the time taken for each of the requirements.

# Economic Feasibility Study

There will be no costs incurred during the development of this project, I will not be spending any money on any special software. All of the software that I will be using to develop this project will be free.

I will list the software and tools that I will be using to implement the functionality and design of the website.

# Technical Feasibility Study

The following tools and software will be used to develop the web application:

-	Zube (List the requirements into sprint backlogs)

-	Draw.io (Wireframe design for the website pages) & backend design

-	Docker.

-	Travis Continuous Integration (CI)

-	Git Version Control

-	HTML5, CSS3 & Express JavaScript

-	Visual Studio Code

-	Heroku for deployment.

# Legal Feasibility Study

Under the Computer Misuse Act, I will not be writing any malicious backend code that will harvest data and/or make services unavailable to users. I will ensure that cookie sessions will be used to encrypt and store personal data of the users visiting my website. I will not be writing any malware or any keyloggers that will impair the user’s ability to access my personal website.


Under the Copyright Design and Patents Act, I will not be making use of any resources that do not belong to me. All of the images that will be used are my own and I have permission to use them, however I will list the links from where I will get the colours and fonts that I will implement on my website in a bibliography at the end of this document.
